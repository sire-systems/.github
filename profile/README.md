# **Sire Systems**

## **Who?**

Sire is a software company that strives to create systems that have the utmost quality and performance. We aim to create software that offers a simply outstanding user experience. There is no annoyance too small and no bug to devious to be dealt with by our team.

### **We're not creating a game - We're creating an** ***experience.***

Sire was established in 2022 by [**Jeremy Bankes**](https://jeremybankes.com). The team is currently developing the tooling and frameworks required to develop their first release.

## **What?**

We write low-level code. It gives us the most control. It gives us the most performance. Most of our codebase is written in C and utilizes system calls for both Windows and Linux. Currently Sire is focusing on desktop development for just the two operating systems.

## **When?**

In 3 more months... Perpetually. Quality takes time.

## **Where?**

Currently Nova Scotia, Canada... or coffee shops in Europe. The amazing thing about being a programmer is that you can carry so much value in such a small form factor: A Laptop.

## **Why?**

Because we can. Because there isn't enough bullet-proof software out there. Because we want to contribute quality. To create user experiences to bring friends and families together and to create new relationships. To have fun.

*To create something for our team worth being proud of.*
